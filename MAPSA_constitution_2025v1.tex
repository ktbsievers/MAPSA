	\begin{itemize}
	\item MAPSA -- McMaster Astronomy and Physics (Graduate) Students Association
	\item Standing Member -- Graduate students in the Department of Physics and Astronomy (membership automatic from date of program start until graduation as indicated by congratulatory email by the Graduate Chair) 
	\item academic year -- Sept 1 to Aug 30
	\item calendar year -- Jan 1 to Dec 31
	\item `unanimous approval' -- All Representatives must Approve (motion is without Abstain or Reject)
	\item `majority approval' -- There are more Approves than Rejects by the Representatives (ties dictate failure of the motion, Abstains counts to neither Approve or Reject)

	This document is the go-to for all foundational questions regarding MAPSA and its operations. On the chance MAPSA fails due to lack of participation, interest, or support from its members; this document shall serve to outline its mission and regulations to those seeking to revive it. This Constitution is the second, with first MAPSA order (created in 2020) having fallen in 2025.
	\section{Name \& Purpose}
	\subsection{Name}
	The organization of McMaster physics and astronomy graduate students shall hereafter be referred to as the \textbf{McMaster Astronomy and Physics Graduate Student Association}, abbreviated to MAPGSA (``map-G-S-A''), but commonly nicknamed and referred henceforth as \textbf{MAPSA} (``map-sah'').
	\subsection{Purpose}
	MAPSA is a collection of peers among the Department of Physics and Astronomy graduate student body \underline{volunteering} to improve the quality of life of its members by the following purposes:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item To provide a platform for graduate student concerns to be expressed to the department and university and to represent the interests of graduate students at department meetings.
		\item To disseminate important information to the graduate student body.
		\item To coordinate, promote, and enhance graduate student social events.
		\item To assist graduate students in obtaining support for issues related to harassment, discrimination, mental health, and inter-personal conflicts.
	\end{itemize}
	It is important to emphasize that this association must not take away from the personal and academic growth of participating members. Members participating in executive roles in MAPSA must be able and willing -- there shall be no coercion of participation from peers, faculty, or likewise.
