	This document is the go-to for all foundational questions regarding MAPSA and its operations. On the chance MAPSA fails due to lack of participation, interest, or support from its members; this document shall serve to outline its mission and regulations to those seeking to revive it. This Constitution is the second, with first MAPSA order (created in 2020) having fallen in 2025.
	\section{Name \& Purpose}
	\subsection{Name}
	The organization of McMaster physics and astronomy graduate students shall hereafter be referred to as the \textbf{McMaster Astronomy and Physics Graduate Student Association}, abbreviated to MAPGSA (``map-G-S-A''), but commonly nicknamed and referred henceforth as \textbf{MAPSA} (``map-sah'').
	\subsection{Purpose}
	MAPSA is a collection of peers among the Department of Physics and Astronomy graduate student body \underline{volunteering} to improve the quality of life of its members by the following purposes:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item To provide a platform for graduate student concerns to be expressed to the department and university and to represent the interests of graduate students at department meetings.
		\item To disseminate important information to the graduate student body.
		\item To coordinate, promote, and enhance graduate student social events.
		\item To assist graduate students in obtaining support for issues related to harassment, discrimination, mental health, and inter-personal conflicts.
	\end{itemize}
	It is important to emphasize that this association must not take away from the personal and academic growth of participating members. Members participating in executive roles in MAPSA must be able and willing -- there shall be no coercion of participation from peers, faculty, or likewise.
	
	\section{Membership}
	\subsection{Eligibility}
	Membership in MAPSA shall be automatic and only for all graduate students in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at McMaster. Such members are Standing Members and remain such between the beginning date of their program until their graduation date (indicated by the congratulatory email by the Graduate Chair). Standing Members are eligible to vote and participate in MAPSA regulatory matters, but participation in MAPSA events is open to all, in accordance with all criteria enumerated in the ``GSA Clubs Operating Policies'' document and is offered irrespective of race, religion, gender, class, age, nationality, ability, marital status, veteran status, or sexual orientation. 
	
	\subsection{Dues}
	There shall be no dues for participating in MAPSA.
	
	\section{Association Structure and Executives}
	\subsection{Structure}
	Standing members are to be part of Constituencies, categorized by their specialty in each field of physics and astronomy according to their supervisors' specialty. Standing members vote at the beginning of each academic year for their Constituency's Representative. The Representatives then goes on to nominate and elect Officers and Coordinators among the Standing Members (including the Representatives themselves). Officers hold the executive roles in MAPSA, but must seek majority approval from the Representatives for most motions. 
	\subsection{Constituencies}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Astronomy}: e.g. students under supervision of A. Chen, L. Parker, R. Pudritz, A. Sills, J. Wadsley, C. Wilson, B. Harris, H. Couchman, D. Welch.
		\item \textbf{Theoretical Physics} (Condensed Matter \& High-Energy): e.g. students under supervision of C. Burgess, S. Sibiryakov, D. O'Dell, H. Kunduri, S. Lee, E. SÃ¸rensen.
		\item \textbf{Soft Matter and Biophysics}: e.g. students under supervision of K. Dalnoki-Veress, C. Fradin, P. Higgs, M. Rheinstadter, A. Shi.
		\item \textbf{Condensed Matter Experiment}: e.g. students under supervision of B. Gaulin, T. Imai, G. Luke, D. Venus.
		\item \textbf{Rad-Grad}: e.g. students under supervision of F. McNeill, D. Chettle, S. H. Byun, J. Juhasz
		\item \textbf{International Students}: Non-permanent-residents or non-citizens of Canada.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Representatives (Elected by Members)}
	Those seeking the role of the Representative of their constituency should first address peers of their constituency before conveying their nomination to the Election Officer. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Representatives}: To be nominated and voted upon by their corresponding Constituency. There shall be one Representative from each Constituency. Representatives hold approval and veto power over the Officers.
		\item \textbf{Meeting Representative}: To be nominated and voted upon by the Standing Members. Meeting Representatives do not have voting power over the Officers as opposed to Representatives. There shall be two Meeting Representatives elected from the Standing Members.
	\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Officers (Elected by Representatives)}
	The following officers are to be nominated voted into their positions by the Representatives. Such officers may be nominated persons among the Representatives or any standing member. No one person shall conduct the role of multiple officers.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Chairperson (Officer)}
		\item \textbf{Communications Officer}
		\item \textbf{Treasury Officer$^\star$}
		\item \textbf{Visitor Coordinator(s)$^*$}
		\item \textbf{Events Coordinator(s)$^*$}
		\item \textbf{Election Tsar$^\dagger$}
	\end{itemize}
	$^\star$the Treasury Officer position shall only be available when MAPSA is approved as a GSA club or when there is otherwise financial reporting that is required for the procurement of finances\\

	\section{Responsibilities and Expectations}
	\subsection{Standing Members}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item MAPSA standing members are \underline{expected} to vote for their corresponding Representative and voice dejection of the Executives when any arises. 
		\item Standing members (and participants) at MAPSA-sanctioned events are also \underline{expected} to conduct themselves in manner befitting of Department and University interests--that is to treat all (participants and bystanders) with a high level of mutual respect, professionalism, and courtesy. 
		\item Otherwise, members are encouraged to enjoy their academic journey with this group of friends--MAPSA is founded on attempting to support and enhance this notion.
	\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Election Tsar}
	an (willing) Election Tsar is to be appointed by the Chair \textit{without disapproval} from any Representative before the Address.
	
	\section{Election}\label{sec:elections}
	Elections are to be held each year during the final week of September by all members for their respective constituency's Representatives. Nominations for the elected Representative positions will take place in the week prior to elections. Only Standing Members within a Constituency may vote for the Representative of that constituency. Elections must guarantee the anonymity of the voters. Newly elected officers take office from October 1\textsuperscript{st} of the year of election to October 1\textsuperscript{st} of the following year.

The organization of the election shall be conducted by the Election Organizer, as outlined in article 3.1.  Elections must guarantee the anonymity of the voters. Newly elected officers take office from October 1\textsuperscript{st} of the year of election to October 1\textsuperscript{st} of the following year. The elections are by simple majority of the voting constituency in the case of two-candidate elections. In the case of a single-candidate election, a majority approval is required. If there are more than two candidates for a given constituency, voting will occur in two phases: the top two candidates from the first phase of voting will compete in a runoff election.
	
	
	\section{Communication and Meetings}
	\subsection{Communication with Constituents}
	It shall be \textbf{\textit{\underline{mandated}}} that MAPSA is allowed two mass-emails (to all standing members) per year, both in the month of September. The first (from the Chairperson) is to report to all standing members of the previous year's achievements, promote MAPSA and its values to newcoming graduate students, and to announce the imminent election. The second (from the Election Tsar) is to distribute means of voting in the Election. \textit{Unanimous approval} of the Representatives must be obtained for any more mass-emails to be sent to the Standing Members on behalf of MAPSA.
	
	Representatives and Officers are encouraged to promote events \& MAPSA agenda by other means, such as the large Discord Community `Astronomy and Physics Coterie' (as of Sept 2025), bulletin boards on the 2nd/3rd floor of ABB \& in the office space in GSB \& TAB, word-of-mouth, and the dedicated Teams channel.
	
	\subsection{Meetings}
	
	\subsection{Yearly Review, P\&A Grad Student Orientation}
	A review of the Council positions shall be conducted prior to the September election period. The standing representation must be approved by unanimous consent of the Council. In the case of non-unanimous consent, the standing representation may be modified according to the following guidelines:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If the constituencies are deemed to have failed to properly represent the graduate student body, the Council must present at least two proposals of constituencies, with one necessarily being the standing representation, for referendum. The result of the referendum will amend article 4.2.
		\item If a committee is deemed to have failed to meet the requirements as outlined in article 3.3, or in the case of a new committee seeking representation on the Council, a referendum will be held to amend article 4.3.
	\end{itemize}
	\section{Changes to the Constitution}
	Due to the experimental nature of this MAPSA attempt, changes to the Constitution are allowed by \textit{majority approval} of the Representatives before September 2030. Thereafter, \textit{unanimous approval} of the Representatives is required for changes to the Constitution.
	
	\section{Removal and Replacement of Representatives and Officers}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Open Representative positions are to be nominated elected by their constituency within two calendar weeks. An Election Tsar is to be appointed by the Chairperson (or by the Representatives \textit{without disapproval}) to conduct these by-elections. By virtue of the regulations, Election Tsar(s) of the by-election(s) may be Representatives or Officers themselves. By-elections are to follow regulations of Elections (Section \ref{sec:elections}).
		\item Open Officer positions are to be nominated and elected by a \textit{full court} of Representatives (that is all Constituencies must have Representation on this decision) within two calendar weeks after the establishment of a \textit{full court}.
